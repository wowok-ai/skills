  WoWok Messenger — end-to-end encrypted communication for pre-order negotiation,
  evidence collection, and dispute resolution.

  Core features: send/receive encrypted messages, generate WTS evidence files,
  verify message authenticity, manage conversations with anti-spam controls, and
  integrate with arbitration workflows.

  Used by customers, service providers, and arbitrators for secure off-chain
  communication that creates tamper-proof audit trails.
when_to_use:
  - User needs to communicate with another party (buyer, seller, arbitrator)
  - User wants to send encrypted messages for negotiation
  - User needs to generate WTS evidence files from conversations
  - User wants to verify message authenticity
  - User needs to manage conversation lists (friends, blacklist, guard)
  - User mentions "messenger", "message", "chat", "communication", "WTS", "evidence"

## Core Concepts

### Trust Model

Messages are **off-chain**, end-to-end encrypted. The server cannot read content — ciphertext is opaque. The server provides **verifiable message ordering** via Falcon512 signatures on a Merkle tree. On-chain anchoring (`proof_message`) is optional.

### Evidence Closure Principle

> **A message becomes valid evidence ONLY when the recipient explicitly responds to or decrypts it.**

- A message alone proves nothing about the recipient's awareness.
- ARK confirmation (recipient-signed receipt) creates cryptographic proof of acknowledgment.
- A reply is the strongest form of acknowledgment — it proves the recipient held the session key and acted on the message.
- Arbitration requires **confirmed, reciprocated evidence** — never unilateral claims.

### Sessions

Every conversation between two addresses has a deterministic session. Messages are ordered by a monotonically increasing `leafIndex` starting from zero, establishing their absolute position. Both parties share the same session context.

## Setup

Before any communication:

1. **Account must exist** → `account_operation` (gen)
2. **Enable messenger** → `account_operation` (messenger), set a messenger name
3. **Get your address** → `account_operation` (get) — share this address with your counterparties

> The messenger name is required for message delivery. Without it, your account has no messenger endpoint and cannot receive messages.

### Account Limit

A single device supports up to 1000 messenger accounts. Exceeding this returns "Maximum 1000 messenger accounts allowed". Use `account_operation → messenger { m: null }` to disable unused accounts.

### Contact Object (On-Chain Bridge)

The on-chain **Contact** object (`operation_type: "contact"`) is the bridge between a Service and Messenger: `Service.um` → Contact → `ims[]` (Messenger endpoint addresses). Customers query the Contact's `ims[]` to find where to send messages.

**When to create**: Before Service publish, when `customer_required` is set (Service.um must point to a Contact). Reuse an existing Contact if you serve multiple Services with the same support channel.

**Lifecycle**: Contact is mutable (unlike Proof/Guard). `im_add`/`im_remove` require permission index 453 (CONTACT_IM). No events emitted on IM mutations — poll `ims[]` field. If Contact is bound to `Permission.um` via `permission_um_set`, clear that binding BEFORE deleting the Contact (else dangling pointer). Full business guidance: [wowok-tools](../wowok-tools/SKILL.md) §"Contact (Service.um Bridge)".

## Daily Communication

The user's daily loop — these are the operations they will return to repeatedly.

### Check Inbox

Two approaches, depending on need:

- **Quick glance** — `watch_conversations` with `unreadOnly: true` lists all conversations with unread messages, sorted by activity. Each conversation shows a preview of the last messages.
- **Deep dive** — `watch_messages` with a specific `peerAddress` to view the full conversation with a particular counterparty. Supports keyword search, time-range filtering, direction filter, and status filter.

**Design note**: By default, retrieving messages auto-marks them as viewed (`viewedAt` timestamp). Set `skipAutoMarkViewed: true` if you want to peek without marking read.

### Send Messages

Plain text via `send_message`; files (WTS, WIP, ZIP) via `send_file`.

**First-time contact with a stranger**: You get exactly one message. Make it count — include who you are, why you're contacting them, and what you need. After the recipient replies, you're auto-added to their friends list and can message freely.

**Guard-protected recipients**: If the recipient has disabled stranger messages, the rejection response includes their `guard_list`. Obtain a passport from one of those guards (`gen_passport` via `onchain_operations`), then resend with `guardAddress` + `passportAddress`.

**ZIP file attachments**: Use `send_file` for file delivery. Recipients extract via `extract_zip_messages`. The file is encrypted end-to-end; `zipMetadata` tracks download status locally.

### Mark as Read

- `mark_conversation_as_viewed` — mark an entire conversation thread as read
- `mark_messages_as_viewed` — mark specific messages by ID

### Manage Contacts

Three independently managed lists. Schema covers all operations — here are the design choices:

| List | Design Intent |
|------|---------------|
| **Friends** | Mutual trust — added automatically when you reply to a stranger, or manually. Friends bypass all spam checks. |
| **Blacklist** | Permanent block — the address can never message you. |
| **Guard list** | Verified strangers — addresses holding a valid passport from any listed Guard can message you. Each entry pairs a Guard object ID with a validity duration (`passportValiditySeconds`: 10s to 10 years). |

## Anti-Spam Strategy

The four-layer protection model evaluates every incoming message: Blacklist (reject) → Friends List (accept) → Guard Verification (accept if passport valid) → Stranger Rules (one-message limit).

This section covers **how to configure these layers intelligently** for different user profiles — configuration combinations, not just field descriptions.

### Stranger Rules

Messages from non-friend, non-guard-verified addresses are subject to a **one-message limit**:

- Stranger sends one message. If the recipient replies, the stranger becomes a friend and messaging is unrestricted.
- If the recipient does not reply within the cool-down window, the stranger may retry with one new message.
- `allowStrangerMessages: false` disables stranger messages entirely.

### Strategy: Choosing Your Protection Profile

The optimal configuration depends on your role and openness needs:

| Profile | Settings | Who Should Use |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Open** | `allowStrangerMessages: true`, no guard list, empty blacklist | Public-facing services, open marketplaces |
| **Guarded** | `allowStrangerMessages: false`, guard list with 1-3 guards, friends list for known contacts | Service providers who want verified strangers only; customers discoverable by specific criteria |
| **Closed** | `allowStrangerMessages: false`, no guard list, friends-only | Private negotiations, internal team communication |
| **Defensive** | `allowStrangerMessages: true`, substantial blacklist | Users receiving harassment from specific addresses; open but monitoring |

**How to help the user choose**: Ask:
1. "Do you want strangers to be able to contact you at all?" → determines `allowStrangerMessages`
2. "If yes, should anyone be able to, or only those who meet certain criteria?" → determines Guard list need
3. "Are there specific addresses you want to block entirely?" → determines Blacklist use

### Strategy: Guard List Design

The Guard list is where anti-spam becomes programmable. A Guard validates that a stranger **meets a verifiable condition** before allowing their message through.

**Common Guard designs for messenger**:

| Guard Type | What It Verifies | Example Use |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Token-gated | Sender holds a specific token/NFT | Premium customer community |
| Reputation | Sender's `personal` profile has ≥N likes | Verified reputation threshold |
| Order-based | Sender has an active order on your Service | Only current customers can message |
| Passport-based | Sender holds a valid passport from a trusted issuer | Whitelist of partner organizations |
| Payment | Sender has made a minimum payment | Paid consultation access |

**`passportValiditySeconds` trade-off**: Short (60s) = higher security, re-verification per message. Long (7 days) = better UX, one passport covers a week. Match to your Guard's use case: payment-based guards can use longer durations; order-status guards should use shorter durations (order state changes).

**Multiple guards**: Different guards can serve different purposes. A provider might use: (1) order-based guard for existing customers, (2) token-gated guard for premium access — both listed, either suffices for message delivery.

### Strategy: Troubleshooting Anti-Spam Issues

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Solution |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| "My message was rejected" | Recipient has `allowStrangerMessages: false` and you're not their friend | Check rejection response for `guard_list` → obtain passport → resend with `guardAddress`+`passportAddress` |
| "I'm getting too much spam" | `allowStrangerMessages: true` with no filtering | Switch to Guarded profile: set `allowStrangerMessages: false`, add at least one Guard to guard list |
| "A legitimate customer can't reach me" | Guard requirements too strict, or their passport expired | Lower Guard requirements, extend `passportValiditySeconds`, or add them to friends list manually |
| "Stranger keeps spamming after cool-down" | Working as designed — one retry per cool-down | Add to blacklist |
| "I disabled strangers but my friend can't message" | They may not actually be in your friends list | Use `friendslist` → `exist` to verify; add manually if needed |

### Strategy: Filtering Messages by Source

`watch_messages` supports `listFilterMode` to segment your inbox by relationship type:

- `friends` — only messages from your friends list
- `guard` — only messages from guard-verified senders
- `stranger` — only messages from unknown senders (highest priority for review)
- `any` — all messages (default)

Combine with `customListFilter` for fine-grained include/exclude logic.

**Practical use**: A service provider checking their inbox can first scan `listFilterMode: "friends"` for known-customer messages (low risk), then `listFilterMode: "stranger"` for new-customer inquiries (need attention).

## Evidence (WTS)

### Concept

A WTS file is a **tamper-proof, self-verifying export** of a continuous conversation. Every message is cryptographically chained; any gap or modification breaks the chain. Participant signatures add non-repudiation.

### The Workflow

When a dispute requires evidence: (1) `generate_wts` → export messages by time/messageId/seqIndex range; (2) `sign_wts` → add your Falcon512 signature (both parties can sign); (3) `verify_wts` → validate hash chain, continuity, and all signatures; (4) `wts2html` → (optional) convert to human-readable HTML; (5) `send_file` → submit signed WTS to the arbitrator via messenger.

> **Key design decision**: Include the **full conversation** when generating WTS for arbitration — not just favorable messages. The arbitrator needs to see who said what, who acknowledged what, and the exact sequence. Selective exports undermine your credibility.

### On-Chain Proof (Optional)

`proof_message` anchors a message to the blockchain, creating an immutable timestamp proving the message existed before that point. Anyone can independently verify against this on-chain record.

### When to Generate WTS

- **Disputes only** — normal conversations are preserved server-side. WTS is evidence preparation, not archiving.
- **When the other party disputes a fact** — the WTS proves what was actually said and acknowledged.
- **When arbitration requires evidence submission** — signed WTS is the standard evidence format.

## Messenger Across Roles

**Customer**: Pre-order inquiry (`send_message` to provider) → submit required info (`customer_required` fields) → track progress (`watch_messages`) → raise dispute (`generate_wts` + `sign_wts` + `send_file` to arbitrator). Full workflow: [wowok-order](../wowok-order/SKILL.md).

**Service Provider**: Monitor inquiries (`watch_conversations` with `unreadOnly` or `listFilterMode: "stranger"`) → respond to customers (reply auto-adds to friends) → request customer info → document agreements (creates evidence trail) → dispute defense (`generate_wts` + `sign_wts` + `send_file`). Full workflow: [wowok-provider](../wowok-provider/SKILL.md).

**Arbitrator**: Receive evidence (`watch_messages`/`watch_conversations`) → verify evidence (`verify_wts`) → communicate with parties (`send_message` for clarifications) → sign attestation (`sign_wts` on verified evidence). Full workflow: [wowok-arbitrator](../wowok-arbitrator/SKILL.md).

## Common Pitfalls

- **One-message limit trap**: Sending a vague first message to a stranger wastes your only chance. Make the first message complete and actionable.
- **Disabled messenger**: Without a messenger name set, your account has no endpoint — counterparties cannot find or message you.
- **WTS range too narrow**: Selecting only favorable messages undermines evidence credibility. Include the full conversation.
- **Guard list without strategy**: Adding a Guard to your list without testing it (`gen_passport`) means you don't know what conditions strangers must meet — you may be blocking legitimate contacts.
- **`allowStrangerMessages: false` with no guard list and no friends**: Nobody can contact you. Always ensure at least one inbound path exists.
- **Stale passports**: `passportValiditySeconds` too short causes frequent re-verification failures. Match duration to your Guard's data volatility.
